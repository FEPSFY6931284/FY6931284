      <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <pre id="Abstract">
      Quantum technologies are at the forefront of revolutionising healthcare within the UK and worldwide. Unlike classical
      computers, quantum computers can leverage special properties, such as superposition, to perform operations that could 
      prove to be a real benefit for the healthcare industry. Drug discovery and medical imaging are just some of the areas 
      which can see a significant improvement to what is available to the medical industry today. Organisations, like UCL and
      the Hartree Centre, have published online regarding their interest in these areas which includes opening up a research 
      hub to explore these technologies. While these technologies are still in their infancy, the UK aims to be a clear frontrunner
      within this field and implementing it within the healthcare industry.

    <p id="Introduction">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <pre id="Introduction">
      Modern computers have been around for the best part of 50 years, constantly improving year by year and have 
      become something that we, as a species, seem to not be able to live without. They allow organisations, such as 
      the NHS, to have access to patient records digitally and even remotely monitor patients to name a few examples (NHS, 2025). 
      The idea of quantum computing (QC) is something that has been around for a similar amount of time but have only 
      really gained significant attraction over the last decade or so. Unlike digital computers which use bits and can be 
      either 1 or 0, quantum computers utilise qubits and a property called superposition (another being entanglement) which allows 
      it to be 1, 0 or a superposition of these states, allowing them to be both values at the same time (Sood, S. K. & Pooja, 2024). 
      This property allows calculations to be done on extremely large scales which in turn can have a highly positive effect 
      on the healthcare industry in the UK from drug discovery to medical imaging. In December 2024, a quantum research hub 
      opened at UCL in London to explore how quantum technologies can be used to “improve early diagnosis and treatment of disease”, 
      showing that the UK aims to be a key player within this field (UCL, 2024). This paper aims to investigate how 
      these technologies can transform medicine within the UK with a focus on drug development and medical imaging.

      <h3>Analysis and Discussion</h3>
      
      <h4>Drug discovery and development:</h4>
      <pre id="AnalysisDiscussion">
      Within the current landscape, drug discovery and development is something that can take years or even decades
      to reach the final product for consumers to use. In their paper, Kumar et al. (2024) state that pricing is a 
      major factor in the current climate with “costs potentially soaring to a staggering one billion dollars”.  
      With QC, the timescale and costs are greatly reduced by expediting the discovery of these new medicines. 
      
      Currently when drugs are being developed, classical computers are greatly limited by their computational 
      power; quantum computers give us the ability to simulate quantum systems, down to the molecular level. Drugs 
      work by binding to proteins within the body and then having a therapeutic effect on the patient. There may 
      be hundreds of drug candidates for a specific cause that react with a particular protein that would take a 
      classical computer too much time that you don’t have, however a quantum computer could identify the right 
      candidate much more effectively (Singal, 2025). Within the UK, The Hartree Centre, based in Warrington, have 
      recently been investigating the possibilities of QC for drug development alongside AstraZeneca (also a UK company) 
      and IBM. In a recent blog post, they have stated that QC can explore nuclear quantum effects and how they 
      can affect the production of pharmaceutical ingredients – recording the effects may assist in optimising the 
      efficiency of drug manufacturing (Hartree Centre, 2025). There is still a long way to go with fully implementing 
      QC into the complete process of drug discovery and development, but this shows that there is definite optimism 
      within the space. 
      </pre>
    
      <h4>Medical imaging and diagnostics:</h4>
      <pre id="AnalysisDiscussion">
      There is no denying that since the early 2000s, the quality of medical imaging and diagnostics has changed in a 
      dramatic way, enabling medical professionals to understand what is going on with their patients in detail to ensure 
      that the right outcomes are made. QC has the ability to potentially enhance what we can currently view, aiding in 
      early disease detection but also with greater confidence.
      
      Current examples of equipment used for medical imaging and diagnostic include MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging), 
      which utilises superconducting magnets and radio waves to image the body via quantum effects, and PET (positron 
      emission tomography) scanners, which uses positrons and gamma rays to image the body (Gonzalez, 2019). Using MRI 
      as an example, as they employ the use of magnets, fluctuations in the fields can cause “errors and disturbances 
      in scans” (Photonics, 2025). Within the article, they discuss the use of quantum optical sensors to reduce these 
      disturbances by mapping the location of the disturbance and calculating how the disturbance affects the field. This
      data can then be used to correct the image, resulting in higher quality imagery and/or spending less time to get
      similar quality to what we are used to today. Within the UK, a paper published in 2024 by Innovate UK and UK National
      Quantum Technologies Programme goes into great detail about how quantum computer/technologies can assist in body
      imaging (Innovate UK et al., 2024). In the paper, the consortium discuss how quantum technologies can be used for
      brain imaging for epilepsy, Parkinson’s and dementia, treatment for brain cancers using quantum tunnelling (particles
      moving through energy barriers) to directly attack cancer cells and also the ability to sense strokes. This is 
      just one of the many areas explored within the paper which shows the UK’s commitment to utilising quantum for 
      the benefit of the UK and beyond.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <pre id="Conclusion">
        The use of quantum technologies within the healthcare sector can clearly be used in a way that would immensely 
        improve people’s lives, and it is evident that the UK wants to be a world leader within this space and be at the 
        forefront of these exciting developments. With continued funding and interest in this sector, this could become a 
        reality. Currently, everything is still very much in an experimental phase, however it’ll only be a matter of time 
        before these systems become fully integrated within the UK’s healthcare system.
