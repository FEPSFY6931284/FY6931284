      Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
      intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
      learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
      candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
      to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
      Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
      sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
      2001).

      2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
      presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
      labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
      subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
      learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
      reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
      classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”
